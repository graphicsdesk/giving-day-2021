In 2019, men’s basketball raised $250,715. In 2020, an abysmal season—in which it recorded only one conference win in 14 games—that was cut short due to COVID-19, the team faced a nearly <a href=\"https://www.columbiaspectator.com/sports/2020/11/24/basketball-fencing-face-significant-giving-day-losses-but-that-may-not-have-immediate-consequences/\">88 percent decrease</a> in donations to receive only $30,487.

While donations for the fencing team are up about 68.16 percent this year, with fencing receiving about $138,752, it still represents a significant reduction in donations for one of the few sports at Columbia that is consistently competitive for a national title."

This year, it failed to meet even its donation benchmark from 2019, raising $180,537—a 34 percent decrease from the previous year. This comes just four days after a homecoming victory over Penn, its first homecoming game in two years, bringing in alumni from all over the country."

This year, the team flipped the script, receiving the most donations among all varsity sports. In fact, the team blew its previous total out of the water to receive $308,190, a startling 419.98 percent increase from 2019. Tennis, whose new state-of-the-art facility recently began construction and will be ready by fall 2022, amassed donations making up over 10 percent of the total received by Athletics."
